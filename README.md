# 🎮 Mini Menu Games

A simple, single-page web application featuring two interactive mini-games/tools: a **Factorial Calculator** and a **Number Guessing Game**. The application uses pure HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript for a lightweight, dependency-free experience.

---

## 🚀 Features

### 1. Factorial Calculator
* **Calculates** the factorial ($n!$) for positive integers up to $n=100$.
* Uses **BigInt** in JavaScript to handle the massive numbers generated by factorials beyond $20!$, ensuring **precise calculation** for very large results.
* Includes input validation for negative numbers and exceeding the $n=100$ limit.

### 2. Guessing Game
* The player attempts to guess a **randomly generated number** between 1 and 100.
* Limited to **5 attempts**.
* Provides feedback after each guess (Too high/Too low).
* Allows the user to start a **New Game** at any time.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

* **HTML5**: Structure and content.
* **CSS3**: Minimal, clean dark theme styling.
* **Vanilla JavaScript**: All application logic, including menu navigation, factorial calculation, and game mechanics.
